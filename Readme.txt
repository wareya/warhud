warHUD, an unoriginal Gang Garrison 2 HUD.
----------------------------------------------------------

Created by Wareya
Inspired by RevanXP's HUD

A (work in progress) full conversion HUD for Gang Garrison
2, designed to mimick RevanXP's TF2 HUD. Makes important
information as clear as possible and removes ugly design
noise entirely.

TODO/Checklist:
[x] Basic health
    - Consider icon outline change for being ubered
    - Changes color based on health (red 55 > orange 50% > white any)
    - Dropshadow options (NO outlines, too clunky)
[ ] Basic ammo
[ ] Charge bars and other counters
[ ] Timers
[ ] Fix up health/ammo design
